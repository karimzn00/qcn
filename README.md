# Quick Commit Note (QCN)

**Interactive CLI to write clean, conventional-style Git commit messages with linting and history tracking.**

---

## Features

* Interactive CLI to generate commit messages following conventional commits.
* Lint your commit messages manually or via Git hooks.
* Keeps a history of all commits made through QCN.
* Optional Git hook integration (`commit-msg`) to enforce commit message rules.
* Configurable commit types and max summary length via `.qcnrc`.
* Lightweight and fully open-source.

---

## Utility / Purpose

QCN helps developers maintain **clean and standardized Git commit messages**. It is useful for:

* Ensuring commit messages follow **conventional commit standards** (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.).
* Interactive commit building for faster and error-free commits.
* Automatic commit message validation and history tracking.
* Optional Git hooks to enforce quality across teams.
* Improving readability, changelog generation, and CI/CD automation.

## Installation via pip

Once published to PyPI, you can install QCN easily:

```bash
pip install qcn
```

After installation, you can run the CLI using:

```bash
qcn --help
```

---

## Demo (ASCII representation)

```
$ qcn new
Select commit type: feat
Enter scope (optional): cli
Enter short description: add new interactive CLI commit builder
Do you want to add extended description? (y/N): n
Commit created successfully: feat(cli): add new interactive CLI commit builder
```

---

## Usage

### Initialize configuration

```bash
git init                 # only if your project is not a Git repo yet
qcn init                 # creates default .qcnrc configuration
```

### Interactive commit builder

```bash
qcn new
```

Prompts:

1. Commit type (feat, fix, chore, etc.)
2. Scope (optional)
3. Short description
4. Optional extended body (opens your `$EDITOR`)

Then QCN will commit automatically if you confirm.

### Lint a commit message

```bash
qcn lint <file-or-message>
```

### Show commit history

```bash
qcn history
```

### Install Git commit-msg hook

```bash
qcn install-hook
# OR
bash scripts/install_hook.sh
```

## Common Errors & Fixes

### 1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qcn'

Cause: Python cannot find the package.
Fix:

1. Make sure your folder structure is correct.
2. Reinstall in editable mode:

```bash
pip uninstall qcn -y
pip install -e .
```

### 2. RuntimeError: Not in a git repository

Cause: `qcn new` requires a Git repository.
Fix: Initialize Git:

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
qcn new
```

### 3. Import "toml" could not be resolved

Cause: Missing dependency `toml`.
Fix:

```bash
pip install toml
```

Reload your editor and ensure the correct Python interpreter is selected.

## Tips

* Always run `qcn new` inside a Git repo.
* Customize commit types and rules via `.qcnrc`.
* Use Git hooks to enforce commit message linting.
* Commit history is saved in `.qcn_history.json`.
